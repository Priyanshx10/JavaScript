What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and weakly typed programming language that is primarily used for building web-based applications and web pages. 
It was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications.


What can you do with JavaScript?

JavaScript can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including:

Adding interactive elements to web pages, such as buttons, sliders, and form validations.
Building web-based applications, such as games, chat applications, and project management tools.
Creating server-side applications using Node.js.
Building cross-platform mobile and desktop apps using frameworks such as React Native and Electron.


Where does JavaScript code run?

JavaScript code is primarily executed by web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. 
However, JavaScript code can also be executed on the server-side using Node.js or in other environments, such as desktop and mobile applications.


JavaScript vs ECMAScript

JavaScript and ECMAScript are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. 
ECMAScript is a standard that defines the syntax, types, statements, keywords, and 
other core components of the JavaScript language. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard, as well as additional features 
and APIs that are not part of the ECMAScript specification.

Here's an example of JavaScript code that uses some of the features defined in the ECMAScript standard:

javascript
Copy code
// Using the arrow function syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Using the let keyword introduced in ECMAScript 6
let message = "Hello, world!";
